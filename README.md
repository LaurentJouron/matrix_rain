A Matrix Rain is a visual inspired by the famous data stream from the film The Matrix, where symbols 
cascade down, representing the continuous flow of information in a virtual world. This project, although 
it has no major practical purpose, is a nod to a classic geek culture. Since I saw the film, I always wanted 
to recreate that effect, and on a rainy Sunday, I got into it. Itâ€™s a little personal tribute, as much as a 
creative coding exercise.

<h1 align="center">In summary</h1>

This JavaScript code creates a dynamic animation of falling characters, typical of the aesthetics of Matrix, 
using an HTML canvas. It generates random symbols that descend to the screen, resizing the effect when changing 
the size of the window. The animation logic is handled by the animate method, which uses requestAnimationFrame 
for continuous and smooth updates.
